# Expence-Tracker
This is a simple expense tracker app that helps you keep track of where your money goes. You can sign up, log in, add your daily expenses, view them in a list, and delete them when needed. The app also shows a colorful pie chart so you can quickly see how much you’re spending in each category.

Everything — the backend, database, and even a small frontend — is built into one single file. It uses FastAPI for the backend, SQLite for storing data, and Chart.js to create the graphs.

You just need Python to run it, and once started, you can open it in your browser and start tracking your expenses right away.
